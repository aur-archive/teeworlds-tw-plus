============ [MOD] TW+ - iFreeze and Instagib-Mod ============

Hello Tees!
Started as experiment and just for fun, even in remembrance of Tom94's legendary
TeeWorlds+-Mod <https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=46951>
I'm glad to present you now the final version of my TW+-Mod.

This modification is mainly directed to Instagib-players but of course Vanilla
is supported too.

TW+ contains a lot of features which might be useful for one or two and is
highly customizable, what means that you can disable features which you dont
want or need.


==== Features: ====

* New Gametypes (Possible: DM+, TDM+, CTF+, iDM+, iTDM+, iCTF+, iFreeze+,
                           gDM+, gTDM+, gCTF+)
* Mute-On-Spam
* Anti-Capslock
* Anticamper
* Chat-commands to control the game
* Private message
* Spawnprotection
* Logging player stats (useful for wars)
* Loltext (by fisted)
* Message loops for chat
* Killing-spree and killing-spree award
* Live-stats for every player
* Emotional Tees
* Laserjumps
* ... many more

==== iFreeze+ ====

As you see it also includes the iFreeze-gametype which was very popular in
old 0.5.

The gameplay is similar to (open-)fng and TDM. You have just one weapon; your
laser. If you kill a player he becomes frozen and cant move anymore. Your team
will score when every tee of the opponent team is frozen, then all frozen
players become melted and it starts again.

Of course you can also melt your teammates: When you stand near to a frozen
teammate, after some time he becomes melted and can continue playing.
You will score both by freezing a opponent and melting a teammate. It is very
important to melt your teammates, otherwise your team will probably loose.

Also included is an extended version of the banmasters, so you have easy
control and you can ban players of all your servers. 

Please note that in the default-settings I will be notified if a player on
your server gets a ban. The sent information (name and ip) will be used to
ban botters from a bigger amount of servers so that they can't simply change
the server to continue cheating there. But there are definitely no automated
bans. If you anyway dont want this, set  "sv_global_bantime" to 0 to disable
the banmaster-feature. If you dont want to abandom banmasters write in the
first line of your banmasters.cfg "clear_banmasters" and add your own
addresses in the following lines.
